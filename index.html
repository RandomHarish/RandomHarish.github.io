  <h1>To: The Love of My Life</h1>
  <p>Old trick, how are you? I miss you so much, like unimaginable much, if you were here with me I wouldn't be able to stop hugging you 

Happy birthday love
There's a lot of things I wish I could be doing with you rn, too many date ideas, lots of sweets, lots of hugs and maybe a few kisses (a "few")

I'm terribly under-prepared this year, that's kinda been the theme of this year lmao, but it's okay I'll still do my best with what limited time I have

This is one hell of a confusing time for everyone, it's hard, it's painful and it's numbing, it's extremely uncomfortable and confusing in this uncertainty, but I want you to know you're not alone, you're not alone at all, it all seems so insignificant, it all seems like it doesn't matter, but you do, you matter, you can make a difference, it's just that it's a really turbulent time, this too shall pass

It's cumbersome really, so much felt but so little expressed, so much to do but so little done, so much unknown but so little known, it's tiring, it's extremely tiring darling, but you know what you're facing it really well, you're doing everything right even though it might not feel like it and I'm so proud of you for facing so many things and still continuing even when everything is so uncertainty and chaotic, you'll never be alone in this battle, I'll always always be by your side whenever you need me, come to me when this world gets tiring and I'll hold you till you feel better, come to me when you don't feel, I'll hold you till you do, come to me when you feel the most unlovable and I'll love you like no human has ever before

Varsha, you know? You're doing things right and I'm not gonna deny that we make mistakes, the pressure of being perfect is something I relate to all too well, I felt like the imperfection, and it hurt, it hurt a lot, but to err is human, it feels like everything I do is imperfect, but you know? You're doing just fine, show me every imperfection you have and I'll love every single one just as much as i love you

Things will definitely get better in the future, I know it will, do you believe so too? I'm not saying things will get any easier, no it never does but we will learn to deal with it better, we will figure things out cause that's what we do, we figure life out as it unfolds, and you my love are exceptionally good at figuring things out, it will get better, as of right now, I'm so proud of you, you're worth everything and you're extremely lovable even when you feel like you are at your worst, Varsha you matter to me

Well this year is a mess to say the least and i really hate how I am not physically there to comfort you. Honest to god, i wish that one day it's just us alone in our house with no distractions at all, not life trying to intervene, not anxiety creeping in, not anything, just us in bed with the cold side of the pillow and a warm blanket gently soothing our cold feet while it rains outside. The knocking of the rain at the windows, the night like dimness, and us, unwilling to let go of each other, cuddling in bed, holding hands, sharing warmth. Even with my eyes closed I'm pretty sure I can see your pretty smiling face in bed, also if my ears feel warm it's because of the um ah yes the AC is off that's why, yes the AC. I'm not blushing, you are.
Tiring day but with you I feel at home, I feel recharged, I feel happy, I still cannot explain how you make me feel so at ease, there's just something in your presence that's soothing to me, we've spent most of our time talking online but remember school and the instances we were together, i felt alive in those instance, I felt like living. You make life worth it, all the sufferings and hardship doesn't matter when you exist

It's getting dark outside and i just miss you so much

Are you tired?
Do you feel sleepy?
Want something to eat rn?
Let me refill your bottle
Wanna cuddle with the AC on?
How are you feeling rn? 
Let me give you a hug, you deserve one 
It's such a scary world but you're navigating it so well
I'm so proud of you
Darling
Varsha
Wifeyy 
Sweetheart 
My love
Love of my life
Dear
My reason to wake up
Wanna shower together?
Come back to bed
<3

Oh my, our non-verbal communication, remember when you asked me if I noticed you holding my hand back when i let go, I noticed, of course I did, i was scared that i might be holding your hand too tightly, it had been such a long time since we last held hands, i couldn't help but hold your hand so tightly love, i loosened up and honestly i was scared that you would want to let go after that but when you held my hand back, i teared up just a little, I've never thought that i would feel so much love from just holding hands but in that moment, I did. The expressions you made with your eyebrows, asking me "what?" Only for me to reply with a nod saying "nothing". When you pointed to your lap, when i said that I wanted to lay down on your lap. i still get so many butterflies thinking about them. 

Can I summarise everything I've said so far?
I love you

I love you so much
Truly
Faithfully
Unconditionally
With all my heart
Till infinity
And back
I'll love you till the day I die
I'll love you even in the afterlife
Till the sun goes supernovae
Till the milky way evaporates
Till the heat death of the universe
Varsha, I love you
And when we start living together, I'll make sure that there's no distance between us at any given time, I'll always hold you tightly, till we recompensate for all the time we couldn't, I'll never leave your side
I love you
I'll always wait for you
I'm all yours darling
